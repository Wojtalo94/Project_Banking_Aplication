# Project_Banking_Aplication

Hello,
This is my first big project in college.
The project involves testing and finding defects on the website: http://demo.guru99.com.
There are 4 software versions (V1, V2, V3 and V4).
The aim of the project is to trace the bugs found in subsequent versions of the software.

The first task was to find one bug in each version.
The second task was to find a bug in the second version of the application and check them in subsequent versions.
